# Console-Finances

## Description

This project provides JavaScript code for analyzing financial dataset in the form of an array that composed of arrays with two fields: a date string and a number for Profit/Losses, e.g. [["Jan-2010", 867884], ["Feb-2010", 984655]]. The project works out the following calculations for you:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.
- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The result is printed out in the console that look similar to the following:

```
